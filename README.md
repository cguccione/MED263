# MED263 Winter 2022, Bioinformatics Applications to Human Disease

## Course Description
This elective course will cover the latest advances in bioinformatics in the context of human diseases. Students will be provided with the practical skills to implement what they have learned in class. Specifically, when the course is finished, students will be able to analyze multi-omics data to understand human disease.

## Office Hours
* TBA
* If these hours don't work for you, send an email to Caitlin (cguccion@ucsd.edu) to schedule different hours, preferrably on Tuesdays and Thursdays.


## Homework
* You will get a homework every Thursday.
* The expected level of homework is that whoever attended and followed well on the Thursday hands-on course should be able to answer the homework questions in a few hours.
* Homework is due by the following Thursday right before class (2:29 pm Thursdays).
* Turn in the homework to TA Caitlin(cguccion@ucsd.edu) by email.
* Show all codes with answers to the questions.



## Final Exam
* Create a hands-on session document to perform data analysis with your own data (public or private data) similar to MED 263 class
* Following this document, students (or others) should be able to conduct a data analysis in the context of bioinformatics
* Turn in the hands-on session document to TA (cguccion@ucsd.edu) (deadline  TBA)
* Present the hands-on session during the class Tuesday, March 8th 2022, and Thursday March 10th 2022 (TBA-minute presetation each)
