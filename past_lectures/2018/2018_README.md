# MED263 Winter 2018, Bioinformatics Applications to Human Disease

## Course Description
This elective course will cover the latest advances in bioinformatics in the context of human diseases. Students will be provided with the practical skills to implement what they have learned in class. Specifically, when the course is finished, students will be able to analyze multi-omics data to understand human disease.

## Office Hours
* 3:30-4:30 pm after class Tuesdays and Thursdays at room 304, MET building
* If these hours don't work you, email to Andre (affaustino@ucsd.edu) or Jihoon (j5kim@ucsd.edu) to schdedule different hours, preferrably on Tuesdays and Thursdays.


## Homework
* You will get a homework every Thursday.
* The expected level of homework is that whoever attended and followed well on the Thursday hands-on course should be able to answer the homework questions in a few hours.
* Homework is due by the following Thursday right before class (1:59 pm Thursdays).
* Turn in the homework to TA Andre(affaustino@ucsd.edu) by email.
* Show all codes with answers to the questions.



## Final Exam
* Create a hands-on session document to perform data analysis with your own data (public or private data) similar to MED 263 class
* Following this document, students (or others) should be able to conduct a data analysis in the context of bioinformatics
* Turn in the hands-on session document to TA (affaustino@ucsd.edu) prior to the last class (deadline  11:59 pm Sunday March 18, 2018)
