### Weka

1. Check if your computer already has Java by running following command in Terminal (Mac OS/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows):
```bash
java --version
```
if not, install [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download)

2. Install [Weka](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/downloading.html), a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks.

3. Start Weka by double clicking its **kiwi** icon or typing commands below.
```bash
cd /Applications/weka-3-8-2
java -jar weka.jar
```


### FAMuSS Data
Download a [FAMuSS data](https://github.com/jihoonkim/MED263/raw/master/week4/dt_283.csv) from Functional single nucleotide polymorphisms Associated with human MUscle Size and Strength study.


This is a process data from Andrea Foulkes' tutorial, [Stat-Gen](http://www.stat-gen.org).
